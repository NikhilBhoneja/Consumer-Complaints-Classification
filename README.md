# Consumer-Complaints-Classification
Machine Learning Project
## Problem Statement

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau receives a significant volume of complaints from customers regarding financial products and services each week. 
These complaints are then forwarded to the relevant companies. To streamline this process, a classification algorithm can be employed to categorize consumer complaints into
 the specific product category they belong to based on the description provided.

## Objective

Consumer complaints about financial services and products represent genuine concerns from customers. This project aims to address the supervised text classification challenge 
posed by these complaints, as each complaint is associated with a labeled product. The objective is to develop a multiclass classification system capable of assigning each complaint 
to its appropriate product category.

### Key Objectives

- Implement a supervised machine learning model for text classification.
- Assign complaints to specific product categories using the trained model.
- Streamline the complaint resolution process by automating the classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is sourced from the [Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database). 
This dataset provides a diverse set of consumer complaints associated with financial products and services.

## Implementation

The project leverages various machine learning techniques to address the multiclass classification problem. The algorithm is designed to quickly classify new complaints, 
thereby reducing the need for human intervention in determining the appropriate recipient for each complaint.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
